# University Universe

University Universe is a social networking web app that allows college students to connect with peers in their classes. Users find their university and their courses and can discuss assignments, studying, and other relevant topics. Students can also leave reviews of the course that can be helpful for prospective students. Users can create, edit, and delete their own posts as well as other information.
